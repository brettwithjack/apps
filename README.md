Pure Javascript Web-based Mobile Apps

Hello and thank you for stopping by! This site is a mobile-optimized, web-based collection of practical applications for every-day use. I started creating these apps as a learning process to get started with basic JavaScript programming in hopes that it will open the door for new and exciting opportunities, and broaden my skills as a front-end developer. These pure JavaScript apps are VERY basic and came from various tutorials and snippets Iâ€™ve found and brought together with what I know best: UI Design, HTML, and CSS. They were easy to create for a beginner like myself, and besides making them available for public use, you can also download the source code and see what's under the hood so you too can learn and alter as you please! I left a plethora of comments in the scripts, but if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to the email below. Thank you again, and I hope you enjoy.
